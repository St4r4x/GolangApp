# CI/CD Pipeline Bug Fixes

This document summarizes the resolution of the two major CI/CD pipeline issues.

## 🐛 Issues Identified

### Error 1: Coverage Analysis Connection Issues
**Problem**: API tests were failing during coverage analysis with "connection refused" errors.
```
dial tcp [::1]:8080: connect: connection refused
coverage: 10.3% of statements in ./...
FAIL	backend/test/apitests	0.010s
```

**Root Cause**: 
- Coverage analysis was running `go test ./...` which included API tests
- API tests require a live server running on port 8080
- No server was running during local coverage analysis

### Error 2: Docker Build Failure  
**Problem**: Docker builds failing due to uppercase repository name.
```
ERROR: failed to build: invalid tag "ghcr.io/St4r4x/GolangApp:4cd3d92": 
repository name must be lowercase
```

**Root Cause**: 
- GitHub repository name "GolangApp" contains uppercase letters
- Docker registry (GHCR) requires lowercase repository names
- GitHub Actions workflow was using `${{ github.repository }}` directly

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: API Tests Isolation

**Changes Made**:
1. **Added build tags** to API test files:
   ```go
   //go:build integration
   package apitests
   ```

2. **Updated Makefile coverage targets**:
   ```makefile
   coverage: ## Generate comprehensive coverage report (excludes API tests)
   	go test -coverprofile=docs/coverage.out \
   		./test/unit/... ./test/integration/... ./test/mocked/... . \
   		-coverpkg=./...
   
   coverage-all: ## Generate coverage including API tests (requires running server)
   	go test -coverprofile=docs/coverage-full.out ./... -coverpkg=./...
   ```

3. **Updated CI/CD workflow**:
   - Coverage analysis excludes API tests
   - API tests run separately with Docker services
   - Better error handling and logging

**Results**:
- ✅ Coverage analysis now works: **64.6% coverage**
- ✅ API tests run separately in CI/CD with live server
- ✅ No more connection refused errors during coverage

### Fix 2: Docker Repository Name Lowercase

**Changes Made**:
1. **Updated versioning section** in GitHub Actions:
   ```yaml
   # Convert repository name to lowercase for Docker registry compatibility
   repo_name=$(echo "${{ github.repository }}" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
   imageName="${{ env.REGISTRY }}/$repo_name:$version"
   imageTag="${{ env.REGISTRY }}/$repo_name:$tag"
   ```

2. **Added repository name preparation step**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Prepare repository name
     id: repo
     run: |
       repo_name=$(echo "${{ github.repository }}" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
       echo "name=$repo_name" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
   ```

3. **Updated metadata extraction**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Extract metadata
     uses: docker/metadata-action@v5
     with:
       images: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ steps.repo.outputs.name }}
   ```

**Results**:
- ✅ Repository name converted: `St4r4x/GolangApp` → `st4r4x/golangapp`
- ✅ Docker builds will succeed with lowercase registry names
- ✅ GHCR compatibility maintained

### Additional Improvements

1. **Enhanced API Health Checks**:
   - Increased timeout from 30 to 60 attempts (2 minutes)
   - Better error messages and logging
   - Proper exit codes for CI/CD pipeline

2. **Better Test Organization**:
   - Clear separation between unit, integration, and API tests
   - Build tags for conditional test execution
   - Comprehensive Makefile targets

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Coverage Analysis (Local)
```bash
$ make coverage
Generating coverage report (excluding API tests)...
ok      backend 0.006s  coverage: 64.6% of statements in ./...
ok      backend/test/unit       0.004s  coverage: 0.0% of statements in ./...
ok      backend/test/integration        2.424s  coverage: 0.0% of statements in ./...
ok      backend/test/mocked     0.002s  coverage: 0.0% of statements in ./...
total:                          (statements)    64.6%
✅ SUCCESS
```

### Build Validation
```bash
$ go build -o cats-api .
✅ SUCCESS

$ docker build --target runtime -t cats-api:test .
[+] Building 7.8s (22/22) FINISHED
✅ SUCCESS
```

### YAML Validation
```bash
$ yamllint .github/workflows/cicd.yml
✅ YAML structure valid
```

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Status

### Before Fixes
- ❌ Coverage analysis failing (10.3%)
- ❌ Docker builds failing (uppercase name)
- ❌ API tests causing connection errors

### After Fixes  
- ✅ Coverage analysis working (64.6%)
- ✅ Docker builds will succeed (lowercase names)
- ✅ API tests isolated and properly managed
- ✅ Comprehensive test separation
- ✅ Better error handling and logging

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Commit and push changes** to trigger CI/CD pipeline
2. **Monitor GitHub Actions** for successful execution
3. **Verify Docker images** are published to GHCR
4. **Check API tests** run successfully with live server

The CI/CD pipeline should now pass all stages:
- ✅ Lint and Format
- ✅ Unit Tests  
- ✅ Integration Tests
- ✅ Coverage Analysis (64.6%)
- ✅ Docker Build and Push
- ✅ API Tests (with live server)
- ✅ Security Scanning

All major issues have been resolved! 🎉
