The CI/CD implementation is a **multi-stage, parallel-execution pipeline** built with GitHub Actions that provides:

- **Automated Quality Gates**: Code linting, formatting, testing
- **Multi-Stage Docker Builds**: Production-optimized containers
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability detection and reporting
- **Automated Deployment**: Container registry publishing
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and API tests

## 🔧 What is Air?

**Air** is a **hot reload tool for Go development** that automatically rebuilds and restarts your application when code changes.

### Air Configuration (`.air.toml`)

```toml
root = "."
tmp_dir = "tmp"

[build]
  bin = "./tmp/main"                    # Binary output location
  cmd = "go build -o ./tmp/main ."     # Build command
  delay = 1000                         # Wait 1s after change detected
  exclude_dir = ["test", "docs", ".git"] # Ignore these directories
  include_ext = ["go", "yml", "yaml"]  # Watch these file types
  kill_delay = "0s"                    # Kill previous process immediately
```

### How Air Works:

1. **🔍 File Watching**: Monitors your Go files for changes
2. **🔄 Auto Rebuild**: Compiles code when changes detected
3. **🚀 Auto Restart**: Kills old process, starts new one
4. **⚡ Fast Development**: No manual restart needed

### Usage:

```bash
# Install Air
go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest

# Start development with hot reload
make dev
# or
air
```

## 📋 CI/CD Pipeline Stages Breakdown

### Stage 1: 🔍 **Code Quality & Linting** (Parallel)

**Job: `lint-and-format`**

```yaml
- name: Setup Go 1.23
- name: Install Dependencies
- name: Run go vet # Detect suspicious code
- name: Run staticcheck # Advanced static analysis
- name: Run go fmt check # Ensure code formatting
```

**What it does:**

- ✅ **Go Vet**: Finds suspicious constructs (unused variables, etc.)
- ✅ **Staticcheck**: Advanced analysis (deprecated APIs, performance issues)
- ✅ **Format Check**: Ensures consistent code style
- ❌ **Fails Fast**: Stops pipeline if code quality issues found

---

### Stage 2: 🧪 **Unit Testing** (Parallel)

**Job: `unit-tests`**

```yaml
- name: Run unit tests # ./test/unit/...
- name: Run mocked tests # ./test/mocked/...
- name: Run main package tests # . (root package)
- name: Upload coverage artifacts
```

**What it does:**

- 🧪 **Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated component tests
- 🎭 **Mocked Tests**: Tests with external dependencies mocked
- 📦 **Main Package**: Tests for main application logic
- 📊 **Coverage Tracking**: Generates coverage reports for later analysis

---

### Stage 3: 🔗 **Integration Testing** (Parallel)

**Job: `integration-tests`**

```yaml
- name: Run integration tests # ./test/integration/...
- name: Upload coverage artifacts
```

**What it does:**

- 🔗 **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- 🗄️ **Database Tests**: Test data layer integration
- 🌐 **External APIs**: Test third-party integrations
- 📊 **Coverage**: Tracks integration test coverage

---

### Stage 4: 📊 **Coverage Analysis** (Depends on Tests)

**Job: `coverage-report`**

```yaml
- name: Download all coverage artifacts
- name: Generate comprehensive coverage report # Excludes API tests
- name: Upload coverage HTML report
```

**Smart Coverage Strategy:**

```bash
# Local/CI Coverage (excludes API tests - no server needed)
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out \
  ./test/unit/... ./test/integration/... ./test/mocked/... . \
  -coverpkg=./...

# Result: ~64.6% coverage without connection issues
```

**Why exclude API tests from coverage?**

- API tests need a **live server running**
- Coverage analysis runs **without server**
- **Separation of concerns**: API tests run separately with Docker services

---

### Stage 5: 🏷️ **Versioning** (Parallel with Coverage)

**Job: `versioning`**

```yaml
- name: Compute versions based on Git branch
- name: Generate Docker image names (lowercase)
- name: Output version info for downstream jobs
```

**Version Strategy:**

```bash
# Main/Master branch
version = git-commit-short    # e.g., "a1b2c3d"
tag = "latest"

# Develop branch
version = git-commit-short
tag = "dev"

# Pull Requests
version = git-commit-short
tag = "pr-123"

# Docker image names (fixed case issue)
ghcr.io/st4r4x/golangapp:a1b2c3d  # lowercase!
ghcr.io/st4r4x/golangapp:latest
```

---

### Stage 6: 🐳 **Docker Build & Push** (Depends on Versioning)

**Job: `build-and-push`**

**Multi-Stage Dockerfile:**

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Builder (golang:1.23-alpine)
FROM golang:1.23-alpine AS builder
- Install build tools (git, ca-certificates)
- Copy go.mod/go.sum (cache layer)
- Download dependencies
- Copy source code
- Build optimized binary (-ldflags="-w -s")
- Run tests (fail if tests fail)

# Stage 2: Runtime (scratch - minimal!)
FROM scratch AS runtime
- Copy SSL certificates
- Copy timezone data
- Copy binary from builder
- Copy static assets (swagger-ui)
- Run as non-root user
- EXPOSE 8080
```

**Build Features:**

- ✅ **Multi-platform**: linux/amd64, linux/arm64
- ✅ **Layer Caching**: Optimized for fast rebuilds
- ✅ **Security**: Non-root user, minimal attack surface
- ✅ **Size**: ~10MB final image (scratch-based)
- ✅ **Registry**: Auto-push to GitHub Container Registry

---

### Stage 7: 🌐 **API Testing** (Depends on Docker Build)

**Job: `api-tests`**

**Docker Services Setup:**

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    image: ${{ needs.versioning.outputs.imageName }} # Uses built image
    credentials:
      username: ${{ github.actor }}
      password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

**Test Execution:**

```yaml
- name: Wait for API to be ready (3 minutes timeout)
- name: Run API tests with integration build tag
```

**API Test Isolation:**

```go
//go:build integration    // Modern build tag

package apitests
// API tests only run with: go test -tags=integration
```

**Why separate API tests?**

- ✅ **Real Environment**: Tests against actual Docker container
- ✅ **No Mocking**: Tests real HTTP endpoints
- ✅ **Production-like**: Same image that goes to production
- ✅ **Isolated**: Don't interfere with unit test coverage

---

### Stage 8: 🔒 **Security Scanning** (Parallel with API Tests)

**Job: `security-scan`**

```yaml
- name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: ${{ needs.versioning.outputs.imageName }}
    format: "sarif"
    output: "trivy-results.sarif"

- name: Upload to GitHub Security tab
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  continue-on-error: true # Don't fail pipeline if upload fails
```

**Security Features:**

- 🔍 **Container Scanning**: Scans built Docker image for vulnerabilities
- 📊 **SARIF Format**: Standard format for security findings
- 🛡️ **GitHub Integration**: Results appear in Security tab
- 📁 **Fallback**: Uploads as artifact if GitHub upload fails
- ⚠️ **Non-blocking**: Security issues don't stop deployment (configurable)

---

### Stage 9: ✅ **Deployment Ready** (Final Gate)

**Job: `deployment-ready`**

```yaml
needs: [api-tests, coverage-report, security-scan]
if: always() && (needs.api-tests.result == 'success' && needs.coverage-report.result == 'success')
```

**Final Validation:**

- ✅ All tests passed
- ✅ Coverage meets threshold
- ✅ Docker image built and pushed
- ✅ API tests successful
- ✅ Security scan completed
- 🚀 **Ready for production deployment!**

---

## 🎯 Key Features & Benefits

### 1. **Parallel Execution**

- Jobs run **simultaneously** where possible
- **Faster pipeline**: ~5-8 minutes vs sequential ~15+ minutes
- **Fail Fast**: Early stages fail quickly, save resources

### 2. **Smart Test Strategy**

```bash
# Different test types for different purposes:
Unit Tests      → Fast feedback, isolated logic
Integration     → Component interaction testing
API Tests       → End-to-end, production-like
Mocked Tests    → External dependency testing
```

### 3. **Docker Optimization**

- **Multi-stage builds**: Only production artifacts in final image
- **Layer caching**: GitHub Actions cache for faster builds
- **Security**: Non-root user, minimal base image
- **Multi-platform**: AMD64 + ARM64 support

### 4. **Developer Experience**

```bash
# Local development
make dev          # Hot reload with Air
make test         # Run all tests
make coverage     # Generate coverage report
make docker-dev   # Development Docker environment
make ci-local     # Run CI checks locally

# 25+ Makefile targets for every development need!
```

### 5. **Production Ready**

- ✅ **Container Registry**: Auto-publish to GHCR
- ✅ **Versioning**: Git-based semantic versioning
- ✅ **Security**: Vulnerability scanning integrated
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and reporting
- ✅ **Rollback**: Tagged images for easy rollback
