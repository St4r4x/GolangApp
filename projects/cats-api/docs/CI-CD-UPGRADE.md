api-test: # Automated testing
```

#### **Optional Services** (Profiles)

```yaml
prometheus: # Metrics collection
grafana: # Monitoring dashboards
postgres: # Database option
redis: # Caching option
```

### 4. Enhanced Makefile with 25+ Commands

### 5. Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure

#### **Test Script** (`scripts/test-all.sh`)

- 🔍 Static analysis (go vet, staticcheck, gofmt)
- 🧪 Unit tests with coverage
- 🔗 Integration tests
- 🌐 API tests with live server
- 📊 Coverage analysis
- 🔨 Build validation
- 🐳 Docker build/run testing

#### **Test Organization**

```
test/
├── unit/           # Unit tests with mocks
├── integration/    # Integration tests
├── apitests/       # API endpoint tests
├── mocked/         # Mocked component tests
└── test.http       # Manual API testing
```
